📄 Your Makefile Code (with explanations)
makefile
Copy
Edit
# Compiler to use
CC = gcc
👉 CC is a variable that holds the name of the C compiler.
Here, it’s set to gcc, which is the GNU C Compiler.

makefile
Copy
Edit
# Uncomment this line if you want to change the target
# MODULE_NAME = data_types_and_sizes
👉 This is a commented-out line that shows how you could define a different module name if you wanted to.

makefile
Copy
Edit
# Name of the final executable (target)
target = encapsulation
OUTPUT = $(target)
SOURCE = $(target).c
👉 These are Makefile variables:

target → name of the program (without .c extension)

OUTPUT → set equal to target

SOURCE → the C source file to compile (in this case encapsulation.c)

Using variables like this helps if you want to easily change file names later — just update the target value.

makefile
Copy
Edit
# Rule to build the executable
$(OUTPUT):
#	$(CC) -o $(OUTPUT) -c $(SOURCE)
	$(CC) -o $(OUTPUT) $(SOURCE)
👉 This is a build rule.
It says:

When you type make — it will try to build $(OUTPUT) (which is encapsulation)

It runs the command:

bash
Copy
Edit
gcc -o encapsulation encapsulation.c
The -o option tells the compiler to name the final executable encapsulation.

📝 That commented-out line:

bash
Copy
Edit
# $(CC) -o $(OUTPUT) -c $(SOURCE)
Would compile the source file into an object file (.o) instead of an executable. (In this case, it's commented and not active.)

makefile
Copy
Edit
# Rule to clean the build artifacts and backup
clean: 
	cp -u -r ./ ../make_clean_backup
	rm *.o $(target)
👉 This is a clean rule.
When you type make clean, it will:

Copy the current directory ./ to ../make_clean_backup, using:

-u to copy only files that are newer than the destination.

-r to copy directories recursively.

Then, it removes:

All .o files (object files)

The final executable encapsulation

💡 It's a way to reset your build folder, cleaning out old compiled files but making a backup first.

✅ What’s Happening When You Run make
When you run make, it looks for a file named Makefile (or makefile).

It finds the rule with the name encapsulation (or whatever $(OUTPUT) resolves to).

Runs the command to compile encapsulation.c into encapsulation.

If you run make clean, it copies the current folder to ../make_clean_backup and then deletes all .o files and the final executable.

📌 Summary Table

Part	What It Does
CC = gcc	Set the compiler
target = encapsulation	Set the program’s name
SOURCE = $(target).c	Set the source file name
$(OUTPUT):	Rule to build the executable
make clean	Backup then delete build files
